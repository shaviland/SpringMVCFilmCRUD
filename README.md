###Overview
A user can enter a Film's ID and see the details of the film in a web page. If the film is not found, they see a message stating that the film is not found. A user can choose to add a new film. They can enter all the properties of the film. Their input will be used to create Film object, which the DAO implementation will save in the database. If the insert fails, the film not added page displays. A user can enter a Film's ID and see the details of the film in a web page. When a user retrieves a film, they have the option of deleting it. If they delete the film, it is removed from the database. If the delete fails, the page stating that the film is not deleted displays. They are also given the option of editing it. If they choose this, all the film's current properties are displayed in a form, allowing them to change any property except the film's ID. When they submit the form, that film's record is updated in the database. If the update fails, the user is informed of this.
